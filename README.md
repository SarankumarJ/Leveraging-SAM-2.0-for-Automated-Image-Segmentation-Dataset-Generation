# Leveraging-SAM-2.0-for-Automated-Image-Segmentation-Dataset-Generation
SAM 2.0's ability to automatically segment images offers significant benefits for dataset generation. It streamlines the process, eliminating the need for manual annotation.

## Overview
This project leverages SAM 2.0's advanced segmentation capabilities to automate the creation of annotated datasets. The system significantly reduces the time and effort required for manual annotation, making it ideal for large-scale image segmentation tasks across various domains such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and more.

## Features
Automated Segmentation: Utilizes SAM 2.0's state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms.
Efficient Dataset Creation: Generates high-quality annotated datasets rapidly.
Customizable Parameters: Offers flexibility to adjust segmentation parameters.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface for uploading images and exporting datasets.
Support for Multiple Formats: Export segmentation results in formats like JSON, CSV, or PNG.

## Technologies Used
SAM 2.0: Self-adjusting model for automatic image segmentation.
Python: Backend programming language.
OpenCV: Preprocessing images and handling visualizations.
